"R3tr0" identified that the open source project Pi-hole utilizes shell script for 81% of its code. Shell scripting is mentioned in multipule linux forums and is compared to Microsoft Windows .bat files however, as Pi-hole demostrates, shell scripting is a powerfull programing language that can help a user save time and learn bash commands better and avoind learning yet another programing language. 

The Pi-hole service that is created utilizes the onboard dnsmasq service which is a lightweight DNS forwarder which is designed to provide DNS services. Pi-hole however utilizies this service to add a white-list / black-list feature which can be used to block advertisements or entire domains within a home network. 

"R3tr0" conducted a manual code review of the open source Pi-hole project and have developed the following observations based on this review.
