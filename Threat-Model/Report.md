Pi-hole Threat Model
====================

R3tr0 evaluated the open source software Pi-hole utilizing the Microsoft Threat modeling tool 2016 and the previous [misuse cases](https://www.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/03df13bf-2fe3-4b3c-a4bb-1493b038bd23) which allowed the group to identify the threat model against the Pi-hole process. Retr0 developed a level 1 DFD which supports all threats identified within the previous misuse cases within Lucid Chart located [here.](https://www.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/03df13bf-2fe3-4b3c-a4bb-1493b038bd23)

R3tr0 analyzed this diagram and by utilizing the STRIDE model we have identified the following threats as outlined below. 

Spoofing

**16.** Cross Site Request Forgery  

Category:            Elevation Of Privilege

Description:        Cross-site request forgery (CSRF or XSRF) is a type of attack in which an attacker forces a user's browser to make a forged request to a vulnerable site by exploiting an existing trust relationship between the browser and the vulnerable web site.  In a simple scenario, a user is logged in to web site A using a cookie as a credential.  The other browses to web site B.  Web site B returns a page with a hidden form that posts to web site A.  Since the browser will carry the user's cookie to web site A, web site B now can take any action on web site A, for example, adding an admin to an account.  The attack can be used to exploit any requests that the browser automatically authenticates, e.g. by session cookie, integrated authentication, IP whitelisting, …  The attack can be carried out in many ways such as by luring the victim to a site under control of the attacker, getting the user to click a link in a phishing email, or hacking a reputable web site that the victim will visit. The issue can only be resolved on the server side by requiring that all authenticated state-changing requests include an additional piece of secret payload (canary or CSRF token) which is known only to the legitimate web site and the browser and which is protected in transit through SSL/TLS. See the Forgery Protection property on the flow stencil for a list of mitigations.

Summary of Observations 
 =======================
 
 As a simple utility to be used on your home network to block ads, Pi-hole was not designed primarily with security in mind. After reviewing the software design based on our threat model, we have observed some security related issues that could be mitigated. Although Pi-Hole admin interface uses basic password authentication, http traffic is neither encrypted nor authenticated. Using secure https it can ensure password is not sent in the network unencrypted. It is Strongly recommended for Pi-Hole team to strengthen the authentication and encryption mechanisms currently being used. Pi-Hole also doesn’t have any password complexity requirement. In Pi-Hole, user password is the primary source of authentication and we observed that Pi-Hole can accept any kind of password violating the basic authentication principles. Having a complex password requirement could thwart an attacker from guessing the password. Also, observed that the Pi-Hole does not maintain user profiles and there is only non-confidential single userid, which actually increases the chances for unauthorized access. Implementation of User profile maintainance is helpful in customized use, privilige seperation and secure authentication. Finally Pi-Hole could implement integrity checks such as Hashes, Digital Signatures on whitelist and blacklist file to ensure it would not be tampered by an attacker. In Conclusion, Pi-Hole needs to improve authentication mechanism and encryption in order to make itself a secure application and resist against most of the security attacks.

In a simple scenario, a user is logged in to web site A using a cookie as a credential.  The other browses to web site B.  Web site B returns a page with a hidden form that posts to web site A.  Since the browser will carry the user's cookie to web site A, web site B now can take any action on web site A, for example, adding an admin to an account.  The attack can be used to exploit any requests that the browser automatically authenticates, e.g. by session cookie, integrated authentication, IP whitelisting, …  The attack can be carried out in many ways such as by luring the victim to a site under control of the attacker, getting the user to click a link in a phishing email, or hacking a reputable web site that the victim will visit. The issue can only be resolved on the server side by requiring that all authenticated state-changing requests include an additional piece of secret payload (canary or CSRF token) which is known only to the legitimate web site and the browser and which is protected in transit through SSL/TLS. See the Forgery Protection property on the flow stencil for a list of mitigations.</td></tr><tr><td id="threat-title-justification" role="rowheader" tabindex="0"><strong>Justification:</strong></td><td class="infotd" tabindex="0" role="gridcell" headers="threat-title-justification">&lt;no mitigation provided&gt;</td></tr></table></div><br /><h3 tabindex="0">
